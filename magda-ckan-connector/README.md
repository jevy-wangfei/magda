## Building

Requires SBT to be installed to generated the swagger files from the registry.

```bash
yarn run build
```

If you're using Visual Studio Code (recommended), execute `Tasks: Run Build Task` (CTRL-SHIFT-B) to build and watch (build again on changes).

## Running

```bash
node bin/index.js
```
